## AlDente
### Prevent your battery from being overcooked 
- Note for the M1 Macs you dont need to have this app installed as it already comes with a built in battery to 80 percent charge feature.
- This app allows you to set a minimum (20 percent) to whatever you choose as a maximum charge limit.
- once the battery reaches this point it will stop charging your mac and instead keep supplying power to the motherboard
